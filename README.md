# Moddable-Character-Creation-System

This WIP character creation system is made with inspiration from video game modding, allowing the player to easily create their own races and classes for a dungeon roleplaying game by creating and modifying the game's data files.
Running the game creates default files if they are not already present, and these files can be modified or added onto in the player's native file explorer.
